Based on the material from the "Bridges in Mathematics Grade 3 Practice Book" available through the Math Learning Center, here are three tailored learning objectives for a 6-year-old student:

Understanding Basic Place Value: Students will learn to identify and understand the value of each digit in a two-digit number, helping them grasp foundational concepts of place value, which are crucial for further mathematical learning.
Introduction to Addition and Subtraction Facts: Introduce students to basic addition and subtraction facts up to 18. This objective focuses on enabling students to perform simple calculations, which form the bedrock of their arithmetic skills.
Exploring Geometric Shapes and Their Properties: Students will begin to recognize and name simple geometric shapes and understand basic properties such as the number of sides and corners. This helps build a fundamental understanding of geometry.
These objectives are crafted to align with early mathematical learning and are appropriate for a 6-year-old's developmental stage, focusing on practical, intuitive understanding of numbers and basic geometrical concepts.
